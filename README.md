Free MLOps course run by DataTalksClub. The program comprises seven modules followed by a capstone project as mentioned below and spans across several months.

Skills involve: AWS Kinesis, EC2, S3, LAMBDA, Prefect, Mlflow, PostgreSQL, Docker, Docker-compose, Grafana
Module 1: Introduction
* [What is MLOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0uaFZSzwfI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIUISrluw_A7wDSmfOhErJK)
* Environment preparation
* Connect remote through Pycharm
* Edit remote jupyter notebook on your localhost
* Running example: training a ride duration prediction model
* Maturity models

Module 2: Experiment tracking and model management
* Why MLops
* Experiment tracking intro
* Experiment tracking with MLflow
* Model management
* Model registry
* MLflow in practice
* MLflow: benefits, limitations and alternatives

Module 3: Orchestration and ML Pipelines
*Add workflow chart*
* Workflow orchestration
* Turning a notebook into a pipeline
* Deployment of Prefect flow
Module 4: Model Deployment
*Add kinesis stream chart*
* Batch vs online
* For online: web services vs streaming
* Serving models in Batch mode
* Web services (mlflow + s3)
* Streaming (Kinesis/SQS + AWS Lambda + mlflow + s3)
* Batch

Module 5: Model Monitoring

* Intro to Model Monitoring, ML-based services, such as building batch monitoring, monitoring Scheme
* Monitoring web services with Prometheus, Evidently, and Grafana
* Monitoring batch jobs with Prefect, MongoDB, and Evidently
